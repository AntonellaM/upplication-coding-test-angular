## Styles considerations

The application layout for this coding test has been conceived for the usage of the App in mobile phones. Thus, in order to visualise the content correctly, you can: 

1. Use a navigator extension to preview mobile telephones layout such as Mobile Browser Emulator (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mobile-browser-emulator/lbofcampnkjmiomohpbaihdcbjhbfepf?hl=es-419)

2. Use the device toolbar of your browser developer tools
